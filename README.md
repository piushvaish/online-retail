## Welcome to Analytics Dashboard
I have generated this showcase of what I can help our clients with by using the data from [Olist](https://olist.com/), the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.
